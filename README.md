## Content
### 1. Introduction

Nephio is a cloud-native intent automation platform built on Kubernetes, designed to simplify the deployment and management of multi-vendor cloud 
infrastructure and network functions across large-scale edge deployments. By focusing on automation, Nephio streamlines the full lifecycle management
of entities, from provisioning to updates and decommissioning. It encompasses both network functions and the underlying infrastructure required to 
support them, enabling automation that adapts to changing requirements. Nephio is vendor-agnostic, fostering an ecosystem for innovation while 
ensuring interoperability. Its Kubernetes-based approach leverages declarative intent with continuous reconciliation, enabling efficient and scalable
automation. Nephio aims to accelerate the onboarding of network functions to production and reduce the costs associated with cloud adoption, 
ultimately enhancing agility in delivering services to customers [^1].
This project aims at creating demo presenting Nephio capabilities.
